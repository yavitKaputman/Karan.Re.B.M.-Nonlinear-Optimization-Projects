# Karan.Re.B.M.-Nonlinear-Optimization-Projects

Academic projects for advanced nonlinear optimization course.

Parameter-GradientDescentIterations: Demonstrates the relation between the parameter "a" value and the iterations needed by gradient descent method in order to solve: "min (x_1)^2 + a*(x_2)^2"

HyperPlaneCVX: Finds the best seperating hyper plane for a specific dataset using CVX tool.

GradientProjection: Implements the gradient projection method for three specific type of problems.

SignalDenoising: Denoising two specific signals by quadratic and norm-1 regularizations.
